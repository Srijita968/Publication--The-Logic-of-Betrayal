# Publication-The Logic of Betrayal
A mathematical and strategic exploration of the Prisoner’s Dilemma covering dominant strategies, Nash equilibrium, iterated and probabilistic models, mixed strategies, and real-world applications across economics, policy, business, and global decision-making.
# Elucidating Paradoxical Pursuits: A Multifaceted Exploration of the Prisoner’s Dilemma

## Overview
This project presents a mathematical and strategic analysis of the Prisoner’s Dilemma, a foundational problem in Game Theory that demonstrates how individually rational choices can lead to collectively inefficient outcomes. The study bridges theoretical modeling with economic and real-world implications.

## Objectives
- Explain the mathematical structure of the Prisoner’s Dilemma
- Analyse dominant strategies and Nash equilibrium
- Extend the model to iterated and probabilistic settings
- Explore mixed strategy behaviour
- Connect theory to real-world economic, political, and social scenarios

## Mathematical Foundations
- Payoff matrix analysis  
- Dominant strategy reasoning  
- Nash equilibrium interpretation  
- Geometric series in repeated cooperation   

## Advanced Extensions
- Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (Tit-for-Tat strategy)
- Cooperation stability under long-term incentives
- Probabilistic Tit-for-Tat (PTFT) under noise
- Mixed strategy modelling for real-world realism

## Real-World Applications
- Economic exchange systems  
- Government fiscal policy coordination  
- Trade wars & arms races  
- Climate cooperation dilemmas  
- Business price wars  
- Social and behavioural strategy conflicts  

## Key Insight
Rational individual behaviour often generates paradoxical collective outcomes. Sustained cooperation requires trust, repetition, and aligned incentives.
